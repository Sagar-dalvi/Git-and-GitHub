The error message you're encountering suggests that the Git repository
is not correctly linked to a remote repository on GitHub. Here are the steps you need to follow to push your local repository to GitHub:

### Step 1: Initialize Git (if you haven't already)
If you haven't initialized Git in your project directory, do so with the following command:
```bash
git init
```

### Step 2: Add your files
Add your files to the staging area using:
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Commit your changes
Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Step 4: Link your local repository to a GitHub repository
If you haven't created a repository on GitHub, go to GitHub, create a new repository, and copy the repository URL. Then link your local repository to the GitHub repository using:
```bash
git remote add origin <repository_url>
```
Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

### Step 5: Push your changes
Push your changes to GitHub using the following command:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If your default branch is `master` instead of `main`, you would use:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### Example Commands
Hereâ€™s an example of all the commands put together:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
git push -u origin main
```

If you still encounter issues, check the following:
1. **Remote Repository URL**: Ensure that the URL you provided in `git remote add origin <repository_url>` is correct.
2. **Repository Access**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to push to the repository.
3. **Authentication**: If prompted, enter your GitHub username and personal access token (instead of your password) for authentication.

If you have followed these steps and still face issues, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
