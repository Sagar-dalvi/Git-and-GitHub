# Git and GitHub Guide

## Step 1: Introduction to Git

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything 
from small to very large projects quickly and efficiently. It allows multiple
people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work.

### Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo):** A directory that contains your project work and files (hidden by default) used by Git to track changes.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your files at a specific point in time.
- **Branch:** A separate line of development. The default branch is usually called `main` or `master`.
- **Merge:** Integrating changes from one branch into another.

## Step 2: Setting Up Git

### Install Git

- **Windows:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and install.
- **macOS:** Install via Homebrew with `brew install git`.
- **Linux:** Use the package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` on Debian-based systems.

### Configure Git

Set up your Git configuration with your name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
